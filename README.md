# Customer API

This is a simple RESTful API that manages customers.

## Design

The API is designed using the following technologies:

- Django: Given the time constraints, Django was chosen as the web framework for the API as it provides a lot of built-in functionality that would otherwise have to be implemented from scratch or with additional libraries. 
- Django Rest Framework: This library was used to create the API endpoints and serialize the data.
- PostgreSQL: The database used to store the customer data.
